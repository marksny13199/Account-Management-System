# Account Management System 
The tables in this database are dynamically configured by the System which enables it to create database tables without going to mysql command client or phpmyadmin.
In order for it to function:
1. Extract the mysql-connector-java-8.0.21.zip
2. Run XAMPP control panel and start Apache and MySQL module
3. Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ or launch MySQL Command-Line Client and create a database with a name "account_management_system"
4. After creating the database, import the account_management_system.sql to the database
5. Then run the Account_Management_System.jar
